      <h1>Methodology</h1>
      <div id="methodology">
        I tried as much as possible to get stable and consistent benchmarking results. These are 
        the main things I did to get there.

        <h2>Benchmark itself</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Version 0.35.3 of rawloader was used throughout the test</li>
          <li>A set of 60 files from a broad set of cameras was chosen manually to try and exercise 
              most types of decompression algorithm. All the sample files are available at <a href="http://raw.pixls.us/">raw.pixls.us</a></li>
          <li>Benchmarking is done by first loading the file into memory and only then benchmarking 50 iterations of decoding the file</li>
          <li>All the file and rust version combinations were benchmarked five times in random order (to try to eliminate any systematic biases during the run)</li>
          <li>Between every two runs a one second sleep was done to prevent thermal throttling</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data aggregation</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The value for each file and rust version combination is the median of the five runs</li>
          <li>The comparisons are simply the ratio between the time of the two runs</li>
          <li>The box plots were generated in R with the default boxplot() function</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Test Machine</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All benchmarks were run on a Lenovo T460s with a i5-6200U CPU</li>
          <li>Benchmarks were ran overnight with no other user programs running</li>
          <li>The CPU governor was set to performance during the runs</li>
        </ul>
